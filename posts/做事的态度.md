> As I grew "older" I started noticing how many decisions and arguments are based on non-facts like "best practices", personal opinions, "common sense", beliefs, prejudices etc. Need I say this leads to bad decisions? Therefore I am trying to adopt a habbit of judging based on scientific evidence, or as close as I can get.

> Along the scientific way of thinking, I have also changed the way I approach new challenges and projects mentally. Rather than thinking in "success" or "failure", I think of it as an experiment. No matter whether I fail or succeed, I will learn something from engaging myself in the challenge. When learning rather than succeeding is the primary focus of an experiment, the fear of failure becomes much smaller, or even disappears.

很喜欢Java大神Jakob Jenkov的这番话：用实验的态度去对待挑战，成功和失败不重要，重要的是每次自己都会成长。

记下这句话，鞭策自己。
